== Description ==

Rate my Post is a lightweight, responsive and free WordPress rating plugin which allows you to quickly and easily add rating widgets to your posts and pages. You can add rating widget to your posts and pages with a shortcode or automatically in plugin settings (every post/every page, below the content). The plugin also comes with results widget which can be added automatically, above the content of your posts, or manually with a shortcode.

The plugin also has an analytics section where you can see how many votes each post/page received and what is its average rating. It also allows you to change ratings from backend and supports structured data for rich snippets.

What sets Rate my Post apart from other WordPress rating plugins is its simplicity, performance and impact on engagement. It works with any page cache plugin and is probably the most customizable free WordPress rating plugin.

The plugin also features Top Rated Posts widget which displays top rated posts according to your settings.

It does not require any web development skills. However, the plugin is also perfect for developers as it comes with neat hooks. Read more about this [here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/developers-developer-features/). Furthermore, the plugin is based on the [WordPress Plugin boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) for a standardized, organized and object-oriented codebase.
